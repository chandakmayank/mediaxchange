                <h2>Phone Recharge ki Dukaan</h2>
                <p>Over the duration of the Coriolis Effects residency, Swati set up a phone recharge shop in Khirkee Extension. Through this studio in the street, she has been experimenting with informal modes of media sharing in the community. Typically, the ubiquitous phone recharge stores also provide media downloads on mobile phones at 5 to 10 Rs for a movie or several megabytes of songs and video clips. At her shop, through a barter system of media content, she has been co-curating a multi-cultural archive of songs, movies and video clips with her ‘customers’. </p>
                <p>Her intervention in Khirkee’s micro-economy created a media hub for the migrant communities from different Indian states, African nations and Afghanistan. From Bollywood films to ‘Madrasi’ films, from Bangla to Naija music, from ‘bewafa’ to ‘bhakti’ songs, from Bidayesi Bhojpuri  music to its Jahaji Caribbean counterpart – a cultural mash-up evolved, which she played and projected across her street. </p>
                <p>From the 29th September to 3rd October (closed on 2nd October), this digital archive has been transferred to Khoj and from 7pm to 9pm on these days, it will occupy the spaces within and outside Khoj through audio-visual projections. Through your mobile phones, you can explore and interact with this archive set up as a local area network designed by Mayank Chandak. This media exchange has been created through the low-cost, credit card sized computer Raspberry Pi which you can see on the upper floor at Khoj. Just follow the 3 simple steps on the colourful China made electronic items that Swati has hung all around Khoj to talk of the creative amalgamation of OTG devices that takes place at phone recharge shops. </p>
